It's a console-implemented C++ project. The idea of the game is to search for funny objects in the multiple maps, making decisions by typing the commands that the menu indicates. It has a total of 30 unique maps and 19 different items, made by the technique of ASCII Art. In order to give the maps different colors, making the clouds white, the water blue, and so on, I formatted the archives of some of the most important maps. Even if they still need to be processed by a particular function and it is very time-consuming to do manually, the results were overall satisfactory.

This project implements OOP (in order to have 30 equally functional maps), data structures (vectors, sets, maps, etc.), pointers (particularly useful when managing classes), and exceptions (mainly to detect when one of the multiple archives is corrupted or missing).
